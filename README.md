# React + TypeScript + Vite
# My Awesome Project
The Kitten Store website displays a list of items presenting the photo, price, and shopping cart feature that gives each user the ability to add items to the cart and shows how many items are in the cart and the total price

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Typescript, Bootstrap and React

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations
Working on The styling part to deliver a better and consistent UX and UI


## Lessons Learned:
I learned about context feature in React and what advantages it offers in case of scenarios to pass iformation from a parent to child no matter how deep is this child.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
